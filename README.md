# EmguCV-Examples
This repo contains all project files for example solutions that I have talked about at https://aaronsprogrammingblog.com/

**Important:** In order to successfuly compile and run each solution, you **MUST** download and install the Emgu.CV.runtime.windows nuget package. If error persists, just restart your IDE.
